                         GPS SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
  
****************************************************************************  
  
GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM INFORMATION
=====================================
The following Global Positioning System (GPS) information is obtained
from the 2005 Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP), prepared jointly by
the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Transportation
(DoT) and other sources such as conferences, meetings and seminars.
  
The GPS is a DoD developed, worldwide, satellite-based radionavigation
system that will be the DoD's primary radionavigation system well into
the next century.  The constellation currently consists of 32 operational 
satellites.  The U.S. Air Force Space Command (AFSC) formally declared the 
GPS satellite constellation as having met the requirement for full operational
capability (FOC) as of April 27, 1995.  Requirements include:  24 operational
satellites (Block II/IIA/IIR) functioning in their assigned orbits and
successful testing completed for operational military functionality.
 
Prior to GPS FOC, an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was declared on
December 8, 1993 when 24 GPS satellites (Block I/II/IIA) were operating
in their assigned orbits, available for navigation use and providing the
Standard Positioning Service (SPS) levels specified below.
  

TWO LEVELS OF SERVICE
=====================  
The Standard Positioning Service (SPS) is a positioning and timing service
which will be available to all GPS users on a continuous, worldwide basis
with no direct charge.  SPS will be provided on the GPS L1 frequency which
contains a coarse acquisition (C/A) code and a navigation data message.
SPS provides a predictable positioning accuracy of 13 meters (95 percent)
horizontally and 22 meters (95 percent) vertically and time transfer
accuracy to UTC within 40 nanoseconds (95 percent).
  
The Precise Positioning Service (PPS) is a highly accurate military
positioning, velocity and timing service which is available on a worldwide 
basis only to users authorized by the U.S.  PPS data is transmitted on GPS 
via the P(y) code on both L1 and L2 frequencies.  PPS was designed primarily 
for U.S. military use.  It will be denied to unauthorized users by the use of 
cryptography.  PPS is made available to U.S. military and Federal agencies,
and to selected allied militaries and governments.  
  
For questions regarding GPS policy, the user is advised to refer to the
regularly appearing Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP).  
The FRP is published every 2-4 years and is available from the 
National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161.  
The latest report number is DOT-VNTSC-RITA-08-02 for report date 2008.
  
  
GPS SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS
==========================
The satellites transmit on two L-band frequencies:  L1 = 1575.42 MHz and
L2 = 1227.6 MHz.  Three pseudo-random noise (PRN) ranging codes are in use.
The coarse/acquisition (C/A) code has a 1.023 MHz chip rate, a period of
one millisecond (MS) and is used primarily to acquire the P-code.  The
precision (P) code has a 10.23 MHz rate, a period of seven days and is the
principle navigation ranging code.  The Y-code is used in place of the
P-code whenever the anti-spoofing (A-S) mode of operation is activated.
The C/A code is available on the L1 frequency and the P-code is available
on both L1 and L2.  The various satellites all transmit on the same
frequencies, L1 and L2, but with individual code assignments.  Due to the
spread spectrum characteristic of the signals, the system provides a large
margin of resistance to interference.  Each satellite transmits a
navigation message containing its orbital elements, clock behavior, system
time and status messages.  In addition, an almanac is also provided which
gives the approximate data for each active satellite.  This allows the
user set to find all satellites once the first has been acquired.

Future coded civil signals include a second signal L2C at the L2 frequency 
and a third for safety-of-life applications L5 at 1176.45 MHz. There is
also an M code for military use to be broadcasted on L1 and L2.
  
  
SELECTIVE AVAILABILITY, ANTI-SPOOFING
=====================================
Selective Availability (SA), the denial of full accuracy, is accomplished
by manipulating navigation message orbit data (epsilon) and/or satellite
clock frequency (dither).  Anti-spoofing (A-S) guards against fake
transmissions of satellite data by encrypting the P-code to form the Y-code.
  
SA was implemented on Block II and was activated July 4, 1991 at 0400 UT 
(ref:  Notice Advisory to NAVSTAR Users 121-92282 DTG 011354Z JUL 91).  
A-S was exercised intermittently through 1993 and implemented
on January 31, 1994 (ref:  Notice Advisory to NAVSTAR Users 050-94042,
DTG 112054Z FEB 94). 

SA was permanently deactivated on May 2, 2000.  
  
  
GPS SYSTEM SEGMENTS
===================
The GPS consists of three major segments:  SPACE, CONTROL and USER.
  
The SPACE segment, consists of of 31 operational satellites in six
orbital planes.  The satellites operate in circular 20,200 km (10,900 nm) 
orbits at an inclination angle of 55 degrees and with a 12-hour period.  
The position is therefore the same at the same sidereal time each day, 
i.e. the satellites appear four minutes earlier each day.
 
The CONTROL segment consists of twelve Monitor Stations (Hawaii, Kwajalein,
Ascension Island, Diego Garcia, Colorado Springs, Washington DC, Ecuador, 
Argentina, England, Bahrain, Australia), four Ground Antennas
(Ascension Island, Diego Garcia, Kwajalein, Cape Canaveral), and a Master 
Control Station (MCS) located at Schriever (formerly Falcon) AFB in Colorado.
The monitor stations passively track all satellites in view, accumulating 
ranging data.  This information is processed at the MCS to determine 
satellite orbits and to update each satellite's navigation message.  Updated
information is transmitted to each satellite via the Ground Antennas.  The 
Monitor Station coordinates have been precisely surveyed with respect to the 
World Geodetic System 1972, otherwise referred to as WGS-72.  The new 
standard is the WGS-84 and the transition took place on January 10, 1987.
  
The USER segment consists of antennas and receiver-processors that provide
positioning, velocity and precise timing to the user.
  
  
GPS SYSTEM TIME
===============
GPS system time is given by its Composite Clock (CC), that was implemented
on June 17, 1990 at 0000 UT.  The CC or "paper" clock consists of all
operational Monitor Station and satellite frequency standards.  GPS system
time, in turn, is referenced to the Master Clock (MC) at the USNO and
steered to UTC(USNO) from which system time will not deviate by more than
one microsecond.  The exact difference is contained in the navigation message
in the form of two constants, A0 and A1, giving the time difference and rate
of system time against UTC(USNO,MC).  UTC(USNO) itself is kept very close to
the international benchmark UTC as maintained by the BIPM.
  
  
GPS TIME TRANSFER
=================
GPS is at the present time the most competent system for the distribution
of Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI).  The system uses time of arrival
(TOA) measurements for the determination of user position.  A precisely
timed clock is not essential for the user because time is obtained in
addition to position by the measurement of TOA of FOUR satellites
simultaneously in view.  If altitude is known (e.g. for a surface user),
then THREE satellites are sufficient.  If time is being kept by a stable
clock (say, since the last complete coverage), then TWO satellites in view
are sufficient for a fix at known altitude.  If the user is, in addition,
stationary or has a known speed then, in principle, the position can be
obtained by the observation of a complete pass of a SINGLE satellite. This
could be called the "transit" mode, because the old TRANSIT system uses
this method.  In the case of GPS, however, the apparent motion of the
satellite is much slower, requiring much more stability of the user clock.
  
  
CURRENT GPS CONSTELLATION (BLOCK II/IIA/IIR/IIR-M)
==================================================
The current GPS constellation consists of 31 Block II/IIA/IIR/IIR-M satellites.
The first Block II satellite was launched in February 1989.
